🎙️ Speaker: Dr. Luca Fiaschi, Teemu Säilynoja, Jake Piekarski | ⏰ Time: 14:00 UTC / 7:00 AM PT / 10:00 AM ET / 4:00 PM Berlin

Many teams building Marketing Mix Models (MMMs) today must decide between open source tools, and two of the top contenders are PyMC-Marketing and Google’s Meridian. In this webinar, the PyMC Labs team will share the results of a rigorous, apples-to-apples benchmark between the two: default priors, model structures, and synthetic datasets that simulate everything from startups to global enterprises.

You will learn:

How the two libraries compare in speed, accuracy, and scalability
Where PyMC-Marketing offers advantages, and in which situations Meridian might still make sense
Concrete performance trade-offs backed by data across multiple company sizes and data complexities
Best practices and recommendations for selecting the right tool based on your team’s priorities
Join us if you want a clear, evidence-based guide to choosing the MMM library that will best serve your modelling goals, without surprises down the road.
