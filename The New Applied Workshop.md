## What you'll learn

-   How to build and interpret Bayesian models to solve real-world problems.
-   How to run and diagnose MCMC workflows for reliable, interpretable results.
-   Practical skills in using PyMC to model uncertainty and understand complex systems.
-   Debugging, improving, and scaling models that apply to your own work.

## About this course

This **hands-on, expert-led workshop** from the developers of PyMC will take you from foundational Bayesian thinking to advanced modeling techniques. Designed for engineers, analysts, and scientists, this course emphasizes practical use over academic formality, helping you unlock the power of Bayesian methods in your work. At the end of this course, you'll understand how Bayesian models work and how to confidently apply them to your own data and challenges. Topics include:

-   Bayesian Thinking & Model Building
-   Hands-On MCMC & Inference Techniques
-   Advanced Topics: Hierarchical, Causal, & Time Series Models

The workshop is delivered through 2-hour live sessions twice a week over four weeks. All sessions are recorded and available for the duration of the workshop. Students will have access to a private GitHub repository with all code examples and a dedicated Discord server for communication with instructors and fellow learners.

## Who should join?

This course is ideal for software engineers, data analysts, and data scientists who want to move beyond black-box models and start building **interpretable, flexible Bayesian models**. No prior Bayesian experience is required, just curiosity and some Python.
